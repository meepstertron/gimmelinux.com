## FAQ

### Is it free?

**Yes!** Totally free. No account, no signup, no catch.

### What OS is it running?

We're using [**Alpine Linux**](https://alpinelinux.org/), a super lightweight distro â€” boots fast, uses minimal resources, and still packs a punch.

### Do I need to log in?

Nope! Just click the link and youâ€™re in. We donâ€™t want your email. We donâ€™t even ask your name.

### What can I do with it?

âœ… YES:

* Run tools and scripts
* Use it as a temporary dev environment
* Explore and learn Linux commands
* Test out malware in a safe container
* Install packages with `apk`

ðŸš« NO:

* Anything illegal (duh)
* Persistent storage (containers are wiped after inactivity)
* Hosting servers or services long-term

### How long does my session last?

Sessions are ephemeral. If youâ€™re inactive for a while or close the tab, itâ€™ll go poof. But hey, just open a new one.

### Can I install software?

Yes! Use Alpineâ€™s `apk` package manager:

```sh
apk update
apk add curl python3 git ...
```
